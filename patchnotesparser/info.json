XD\n\nThis COG stores a JSON file called `designer_icons.json`.\nIt also requires the following libraries to work: `bs4, typing, requests, rivercogutils` (https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/rivercogutils).\nIt does a few GET requests to https://leagueoflegends.com and https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com to get all the data needed for parsing.\n\nPlease do set the default bug report channel by using `[p]pnparser set bugreportchannel <channel_id>`.\nTo parse use `[p]pnparser parse all <patch_notes_version>` or type `[p]pnparser help` to see all available commands.",
